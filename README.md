It's my skybet tech

For this test I used as technologies PHP and XML

I create 3 files php that make the CRUD operation on the file XML.

There is also a search function make with a plugin of Jquery

As layout I Used Foundation 6 and font awesone for the icon, so this web application is responsive.

I used also inside the php code a php method for prevent the attack from XSS.
